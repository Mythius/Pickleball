# Pickleball
 
 Sep 28
 I created the html and css for my pickleball application.

I also integrated the google sign in, so that it is functional. 

I created my pages with placeholders for database records and websocket requests.

I created everything in normal html / css / javascript but plan on converting it to a react app.
