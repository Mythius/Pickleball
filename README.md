# Pickleball
 
 Sep 28
 I created the html and css for my pickleball application.

I also integrated the google sign in, so that it is functional. 

I created my pages with placeholders for database records and websocket requests.

I created everything in normal html / css / javascript but plan on converting it to a react app.

## Oct 12, 2024 CSS Change
So As I did most of the CSS last time, and after discussing this with Dr. Clement, he informed me that I should focus my time working with React to get the most of this class. So instead I am turning in part one of converting this project to React. I was able to get some components built and styled. If you have any questions let me know.

## React Branch
All of the changes I have made in converting my project to react are in the React branch on github see https://github.com/Mythius/Pickleball/tree/react for the latest code.
The live demo is currently being deployed from the react build.
